**Original:**

It has been a long time to write a diary.

I was tired of doing the same daily tasks every week.

It’s so boring.

I felt that I couldn’t be engaged in these things which I planned in the begin of this year.

I hoped I can adjust my mind to restart again in the past three months.

Unfortunately, I failed.

In these two days, I finally can face my failure.

I knew that I couldn’t achieve my year goals but I still wanted to form a habit to learn English and do meditation to improve my life better.

I have some words for myself:

Keep going and practicing. Don’t give in early.

Being the guy better than yesterday.

###### Revised: 
###### It has been a long time since I last wrote a diary.
###### I was tired of doing the same daily tasks every week.
###### It felt so boring.
###### I realized that I couldn’t stay engaged with the things I planned at the beginning of this year.
###### I hoped I could adjust my mindset and restart during the past three months.
###### Unfortunately, I failed.
###### Over the past two days, I finally faced my failure.
###### I know I won’t be able to achieve my yearly goals, but I still want to develop the habit of learning English and meditating to improve my life.
###### Here are some words for myself:
###### Keep going and practicing. Don’t give up too soon.
###### Be someone better than you were yesterday.


**Explanation:**
1. Tense correction:

   * Changed "It has been a long time to write a diary" to "It has been a long time since I last wrote a diary" for grammatical accuracy and natural phrasing.

   * Updated "I felt that I couldn’t be engaged" to "I realized that I couldn’t stay engaged" to match the intended meaning and improve fluency.

2.	Natural phrasing:

   * Changed "in the begin of this year" to "at the beginning of this year" for correctness.

   * Adjusted "improve my life better" to "improve my life" (avoiding redundancy, as "improve" already implies "better").

   * Rephrased "Being the guy better than yesterday" to "Be someone better than you were yesterday" for a smoother, more natural expression.

3.	Clarity and tone:

   * Changed "I have some words for myself" to "Here are some words for myself" to make it flow better in context.

   * Improved motivational tone by refining "Don’t give in early" to "Don’t give up too soon."
