**Original:**

I had gotton serious sick for past three weeks.

I didn’t do any important things for year goals due to heavy sick.

Today is November third only one month to December.

My goals only reach one of three.

I am going to attend the N3 Japenese test at December third but just had read one book in N5.

I will do my best to read in the left days even though I think it’s hard for me to pass the test.

By the way I going to apply for the toeic test at Febulary or March.

In the new year continue keeping the goals that are not achieving .

###### Revised: 
###### I have been seriously sick for the past three weeks.
###### I couldn’t work on any important goals for the year because of it.
###### Today is November 3rd, and there’s only one month until December.
###### So far, I've only reached one out of my three goals.
###### I'm going to take the N3 Japanese test on December 3rd, but I’ve only read one N5 book.
###### I’ll do my best to study in the remaining days, even though I know it will be hard to pass.
###### By the way, I’m planning to apply for the TOEIC test in February or March.
###### Next year, I’ll keep working on the goals that I haven’t achieved yet.


**Explanation:**
1. Verb tense and clarity: Changed "I had gotton serious sick" to "I have been seriously sick" for correct tense and natural phrasing.

2. Improving readability: Replaced "heavy sick" with "because of it" to make it sound smoother.

3. Consistency in dates: Using "November 3rd" and "December 3rd" instead of "November third" and "December third" for consistency.

4. Natural phrasing: Adjusted "only reach one of three" to "only reached one out of my three goals" for better clarity.

5. Specific wording: "In the new year continue keeping the goals" was updated to "Next year, I’ll keep working on the goals" for a smoother expression.
