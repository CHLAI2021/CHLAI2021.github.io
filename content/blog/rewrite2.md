**Original:**

1. **This Japanese hotel bans you from wearing perfume in your room**

2. **Smoke, vape, too much perfume or cologne. They all trigger migraines for me. The last few years with the explosion in popularity with vapes has been a nightmare.**


**rewrite:**

1. It’s banned to wear perfume in your room when you stay at this hotel.

2. Smoke, vape, too much perfume or cologne.
These scents can cause me migraines specially vape which has an explosion popularity in recently.

**example:**

1. At this Japanese hotel, wearing perfume in your room is banned.

2. Smoke, vaping, or heavy perfumes and colognes can all give me migraines. The explosion in vaping's popularity in recent years has been especially difficult to deal with.

###### Feedback 01: 

* "It's banned to wear" 的表達可以更自然地改為 "Wearing perfume is banned."

* 加入 "Japanese hotel" 讓描述更具體且符合原句。


###### Feedback 02 : 

* "Specially" 應改為 "especially"。

* "Has an explosion popularity in recently" 的表達不自然，應改為 "has become increasingly popular in recent years" 或類似更地道的說法。


* 連接兩段時，避免過於生硬，可以加入像 "For instance" 或 "In particular" 等過渡詞。


**Reflection:**

1. It’s banned to wear perfume" 偏中式英語 => Wearing perfume is banned

2. explosion in popularity 這是慣用語，形容某事物突然變得非常流行。Has an explosion popularity 錯誤用法

3. with the surge in popularity 增長速度快但較溫和

4. Voc
* vaping : the use of e-cigarettes
* migraine : severe continuous pain in the head
