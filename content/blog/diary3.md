###### Revised: 
###### I went back home to celebrate my mother’s birthday.
###### I took the train at 9:50 AM from Tainan.
###### By the way, I was confused because today is Monday—why were there so many people at the train station?
###### It seemed like they were traveling for leisure, not for business.
###### I hope that one day I can work not just for money but also have more time to do the things I love.
###### When I arrived in Kaohsiung, I called my mom to pick me up.
###### At noon, I ate some noodles my aunt cooked and then took a nap.
###### At 5 o’clock, we went to a Hong Kong-style restaurant for dinner.
###### The food tasted great and was reasonably priced.
###### I returned to Tainan that same day because I had to work the next day.



**Explanation:**

1. "I took train" → "I took the train": "The train" is the correct phrase here.

2. "By the way, I felt confused that today is Monday" → "By the way, I was confused because today is Monday": This sounds more natural and fluent.

3. "Why so many people at train station?" → "Why were there so many people at the train station?" Corrected grammar to form a proper question.

4. "they seems to travel" → "It seemed like they were traveling": Corrected verb form and phrasing for clarity.

5. "While I arrived" → "When I arrived": "When" is the proper conjunction here.In contrast, "while" is generally used to indicate two actions happening at the same time or to show contrast. Since you're not emphasizing two actions happening simultaneously but rather the moment you arrived, "when" is the correct choice.

6. "At non" → "At noon": Corrected spelling.

7. "5 o’clock, We" → "5 o’clock, we": Lowercase for "we."

8. "have an affordable price" → "was reasonably priced": "Reasonably priced" is a more natural expression.

9. "I went back to Tainan at that day" → "I returned to Tainan that same day": "Returned" and "that same day" sound more natural.
