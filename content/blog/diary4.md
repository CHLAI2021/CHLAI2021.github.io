**Original:**

I watched a movie called Insight Out 2 yesterday.

I had watched one in the past but if you didn’t it doesn’t matter you still can enjoy this movie.

In Insight 2, it tells us when we grow older we are not just with our family.
We are not feel simple emotions: happy, sad, fear, disgust, angry.

We are faced with more conditions: 

we want to receive respect from others, we need friends' support, we look forward to having a good appearance, we don’t want to disappoint others.

We have more emotions like anxiety, embarrassment, envy, and ennui.

When we are young, we are sensitive and may hurt people who really care about us, but not on purpose.

We may try to pretend to be confident but end up being too proud.

We may do many foolish things to prove we are different.

In that movie, Joy and Anxiety are doing the same thing—they want to decide what is best for their person.

In real life, both good and bad experiences make you stronger.

Because of terrible experiences, we learn how to become the person we want to be.

It’s worth watching.

**Explanation:**
1. Title correction: It's Inside Out not Insight Out. I also made it Inside Out 2 to match the movie's title.

2. Verb consistency: "I had watched one in the past" → "I had seen the first one before" sounds smoother and is clearer.

3. Improved phrasing: I adjusted sentences like "We are faced more conditions" to "We face more complex situations" for clarity.

4. More natural expression: Phrases like "it deserves you to give it a watch" were changed to "It’s worth watching" for a more natural tone.
