**Original:**

**I have finished a coursera course.**

**In that class, I learned three things.**

**First: How to success.**

**You have to be patient to wait the right time and make all preparation that you can do.**

**But it not enough. The most of all things you let your competitor be surprised.**

**Second: don't give up**

**Even though you are in dark time never give in and find the things you can do. In some day you will find your way.**

**Third:**

**You should keep warning in the peak time. Always be humble.**




###### Revised: 
###### I finished a Coursera course.
###### In that class, I learned three important things.
###### First: Be Prepared, But Always Surprise.
###### You have to be patient, wait for the right time, and make all the preparations you can.
###### But that’s not enough. Most importantly, you must take actions that surprise your competitors.
###### Second: Persevere Through Tough Times.
###### Even during dark times, never give up. Focus on what you can do, and one day you’ll find your way.
###### Third: Stay Humble During Success
###### Stay cautious during times of success. Always remain humble.



**Explanation:**

1. "How to success" → "How to succeed": "Succeed" is the correct verb form.

2. "make all preparation that you can do" → "make all the preparations you can": "Preparations" is plural, and"that you can do" is unnecessary.

3. "But it not enough" → "But that’s not enough": Corrected grammar.

4. "The most of all things you let your competitor be surprised" → "Most importantly, you must take actions that  surprise your competitors": This phrasing is more natural and clearer.

5. "in dark time" → "during dark times": "During dark times" is the more common phrase.

6. "In some day" → "one day": "One day" sounds more natural.

7. "keep warning in the peak time" → "stay cautious during times of success": "Stay cautious" is a clearer way to express the idea, and "during times of success" is a smoother phrase.

8. "Always be humble" is good and clear as is!
