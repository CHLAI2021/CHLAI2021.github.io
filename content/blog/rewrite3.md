**Original:**

1. Sorting through Grandma’s belongings before they are sold or donated and found a uranium glass swan.

2. Someone made the Mona Lisa out of BBQ sauce at the McDonalds by my work.


**rewrite:**

1. Finding a uranium glass swan is in Grandma’s belongings when I was sorting before they are sold or donated.

2. BBQ sauce is used to form a Mona Lisa by someone in my work time.


**example:**

1. I found a uranium glass swan while sorting through Grandma’s belongings before they were sold or donated.

2. Someone used BBQ sauce to create the Mona Lisa at the McDonald’s near my workplace.


###### Feedback 01: 

* 語法問題：主句和從句不協調，句子的結構不夠流暢。

* 被動語態的使用："Finding a uranium glass swan is in..." 不符合語法，因為主語和謂語不匹配。

* 時態不一致："is in" 和 "I was sorting" 混用不同的時態。


###### Feedback 02: 

* 語序不自然："BBQ sauce is used to form..." 過於正式且不符合口語表達的習慣。

* 時間描述不清晰："in my work time" 不夠道地，應該表達為 "during my work hours" 或其他更具體的描述。

* 上下文的清晰性：原句中 "at the McDonald’s by my work" 更能表達地點細節。


**Reflection:**

1. 被動語態還不夠熟

I found a uranium glass swan in..." =>我發現

It was found that a uranium glass swan was in.. =>東西被發現

2. 前後時態不一致

3. during my work hours 其他可替換句子

* 正式 : During working hours / At work

* 口語 : When I was on the clock / During my shift
