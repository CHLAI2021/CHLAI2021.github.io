**Original:**

1. **While traveling in another state, I found a ring on the floor nearly identical to the one I was wearing**

2. **after sitting in a box for a year, the fake blood in a halloween syringe pen completely disappeared**

**rewrite:**

1. Traveling sometimes can bring us surprising thing like someone may has the same things with you.

2. Passing a year ,the fake blood completely disappeared out of the pen.

**example:**

1. Traveling can sometimes bring surprising experiences, like finding something nearly identical to what you have

2. After a year in a box, the fake blood in the Halloween syringe pen completely disappeared.

###### Feedback 01: 
1. 語法修正：

* "has" 應改為 "have" 因為 "someone" 在這裡表示不特定的人，應與 "may" 搭配原形動詞。
* "things with you" 建議改為 "things as you do" 或 "things that are similar to yours"，讓意思更清楚。

2. 用詞改進：

* "Surprising thing" 可以改為 "a surprising experience" 或 "surprises" 來讓表達更自然。
* "Traveling sometimes can bring us" 建議簡化為 "Traveling can sometimes bring" 讓句子更簡潔。


###### Feedback 02 : 

1. 語法與結構：

* "Passing a year" 是中文式表達，應改為更自然的英文表達，例如 "After a year" 或 "A year later"。

* "disappeared out of the pen" 語法上可理解，但稍微冗長且不太地道，建議改為 "disappeared from the pen" 或直接簡化為 "disappeared."

2. 語意與風格：

* 原句提到 "sitting in a box"，這是個具體細節，若能保留會讓句子更完整。

* 可以考慮加入 "Halloween syringe pen" 的細節，幫助描述更加具體生動。


**Reflection:**

1. New voc: 
* syringe 注射器
* identical 完全相同的

2. Passing a year 是中文式表達,要用 After a year or A year later

3. disappeared from is more common use.
